# How To Create a folder in a GitHub Repository?

To create a folder in a GitHub repository and want to add files in that folder follow the following simple steps.

    Remember we cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, 
    but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file.

 ### Step 1: Open the repository where you want to create a folder. 

 Primarly make sure you are on the page showed in the figure below to get the repository created after your team name.

 ### Step 2: Find and Open your repository.

 Example: Let's open the repository of team **Felix** as showed in the figure below

  ### Step 3: Create folder and file in the repository.
  
  Once you are in the target repository, click on **Add file** and in that click on **Create new file**. See the figure below

Then in the name of the **file box** at the top, enter the _**Name of your folder**_ you want to give. See the figure below

After you properly type the folder name, use the **/** character after the name of the folder. Using this **forward slash** you created the folder.

Now you can see a **new box** appear next to the folder name wherein you can type the name of your file with the right extension and add some coontent like your aspiration.
